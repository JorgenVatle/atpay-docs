# PHP
Accessing the ATPay API through PHP couldn't be simpler. 
Below, you will find examples for communicating with the API through [Guzzle](#guzzle) and [cURL](#curl).

::: tip CHECK YOUR PHP VERSION
The below examples assume you're using PHP v7 or greater. <br>
If you're on an older version, remove the type definitions from the below functions. <br>
If you're below PHP v5.4, replace the `[]` array references with `array()`
